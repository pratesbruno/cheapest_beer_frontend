# Beer scraper - ZÃ© Delivery - Front-end
Front-end for the Cheapest Beer project that scrapes a beer delivery website and returns the cheapest beers subject to the user address and restrictions.

The full project involves web scraping, text processing, creating python packages, creating an API, using Docker, deploying with Google Container and Google Cloud Run,
building a front-end in Streamlit, using Pandas for some data manipulation, and finally deploying the final app in Heroku.

The main code of this project, including the detailed description, motivation, the scraper and the API, can be found at: https://github.com/pratesbruno/cheapest_beer_ze

The deployed app can be found at: https://cheapest-beer-ze.herokuapp.com/
